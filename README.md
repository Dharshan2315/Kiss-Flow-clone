1. Setting Up the Project:

Create a new folder for your project and organize your files. You'll need HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. You can also use a code editor like Visual Studio Code or Sublime Text to make the development process easier.
2. Building the HTML Structure:

Create an index.html file to structure your web page. You'll need sections for the header, workflow creation area, and workflow list.
3. Designing the User Interface with CSS:

Create a styles.css file to style your application. Consider using CSS Grid or Flexbox for layout management. Design a clean and user-friendly interface that resembles Kissflow's design.
